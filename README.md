# Twitter Trader
Trading bot that conducts market orders based on tweets made by popular tweeters.
Inspired by JP Morgan's "Volfefe" index, which measures the impact Donald Trump's tweets on market volatility.

The thought process for the bot is quite simple:
1. Conduct sentiment analysis on tweet (is it good news or bad news?)
2. Make a buy/sell order appropriately (for Trump, associate with SPY, the general S&P index)
